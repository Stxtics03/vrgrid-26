"""Native-scatter shim for FRNet's frustum reductions. Opt-in, verified, local.

    from frnet_fast_scatter import enable

    python scripts/frnet_fast_scatter.py          # standalone: verify + time it

`src/perception/frnet/frustum_encoder.py` implements `scatter_max` and
`scatter_mean` as `for i in range(dim_size)` loops that build a full-length
boolean mask per output slot. `dim_size` is the number of OCCUPIED frustum
pixels -- about 25,000 -- so each call is ~25,000 iterations over a 124,000-row
tensor, and a forward pass makes SEVEN such calls: two in the encoder, and five
through `frnet_backbone.point2frustum` (once before the stage loop, once per
each of the four stages). Measured 3 Sep on this machine, CUDA, one seq 00
frame: `voxel_encoder` 4,678.5 ms of a 10,535.1 ms forward. That is 3.3 hours
for a 600-step fine-tune and ~35 minutes for `frnet_eval.py --frames 200`.

`torch.Tensor.scatter_reduce` does the same reduction natively, three orders of
magnitude faster at these shapes, matching the loop's empty-slot convention
both ways.

⚑ "BIT-IDENTICAL" IS TRUE OF scatter_max AND NOT OF scatter_mean, ON EITHER
  DEVICE. The 3 Sep log recorded max abs diff 0.000e+00 for both reductions,
  measured on CPU at one shape; that zero was luck. `scatter_max` really is
  exact everywhere -- max is order-independent, so no summation order can move
  it. `scatter_mean` is not, on CPU or CUDA, because the native kernel sums a
  slot's rows in a different order than `src[mask].mean(dim=0)` does and float
  addition is not associative. Measured on CPU:

      n=800    slots=200    ch=8    1.192e-07   1 ulp
      n=20000  slots=4000   ch=64   0.000e+00   0 ulp   <- the shape 3 Sep used
      n=20000  slots=4000   ch=8    2.384e-07   2 ulp
      n=124000 slots=25000  ch=16   3.576e-07   3 ulp

  The error grows with rows-per-slot, which is what sets how many additions
  accumulate. So the honest claim is not bit-identity but agreement to within
  a few float32 ulp, and verify() gates `scatter_max` at exactly zero and
  `scatter_mean` at a stated ulp bound. The substitution is then proven where
  it actually matters, by re-deriving the reported figures through
  `frnet_eval.py --fast-scatter`: 90.3% point accuracy, 65.2% mIoU and 61.1%
  drivable mIoU come out equal on both paths, with three of fifteen per-class
  IoUs moving by 0.1 pp.

⚑ THIS FILE DOES NOT EDIT JP'S PORT. `src/perception/frnet/` is a deliberately
  frozen reference port (`extend-exclude` in pyproject.toml) and is his to
  change; the finding is written up for him in `docs/research-log.md`, 3 Sep.
  This is a runtime monkey-patch living in `scripts/`, applied only by scripts
  that ask for it with `--fast-scatter`. Nothing imports it implicitly, the
  frozen source keeps computing exactly what it computes today, and deleting
  this file restores the slow path everywhere.

⚑ PATCH BOTH MODULES OR PATCH NEITHER. `frnet_backbone.py` does
  `from .frustum_encoder import scatter_max` at import time, which BINDS the
  function object into its own namespace. Rebinding only
  `frustum_encoder.scatter_max` leaves the backbone's five calls -- the majority
  of them -- still running the loop, and the run merely looks disappointing
  rather than broken. `enable()` rebinds the name in every module that holds it.

⚑ THE ARGMAX RETURN IS DROPPED, ON PURPOSE. The loop's second return value is
  already wrong: `argmax[i]` holds the index within the masked subset, not into
  the full input as `torch_scatter.scatter_max` returns. All three call sites
  discard it (`voxel_feats, _ = ...`), which is why the port scores 98.3% with
  the bug in it. `scatter_reduce` provides no argmax at all, so this shim
  returns None -- a caller that starts using it gets an immediate TypeError
  instead of a silently wrong index.

⚑ GRADIENTS, WHICH THE 3 SEP MEASUREMENT DID NOT COVER. That measurement was
  forward-only and a fine-tune needs the backward half to be right too, so
  `verify()` checks it. The risk was ties: `amax` splits gradient evenly among
  tied maxima where `Tensor.max(dim=0)` hands all of it to the first, and ties
  are reachable here because ReLU emits exact zeros. Measured, the max backward
  is exact and the mean backward carries the same few ulp as its forward.
  Checked rather than assumed away, and re-checked on every enable().
