"""What question can the plan-regret window actually pose? Math §7.1, §8.1.
[Shrestha]

    python scripts/plan_query_survey.py [--frames 12] [--map]

This exists because of one open item. `regret_plot.py`'s curve has no knee,
the diagnosis in its docstring is that `eval_synthetic.PLAN_LANE_CELLS` runs
the path down a lane the scene's hazards are not on, and the agreed next step
is to reposition the query so it has to decide about one of them. Aakash's
note is that changing the experiment after seeing which answer it gives is how
a figure stops being evidence, and he is right, so this script is deliberately
built so that it *cannot* be used to tune:

    ⚑ It never computes R(S). Not once, not for a candidate query, not as a
      diagnostic. It reports what the costmaps CONTAIN -- which cells M* calls
      impassable and why, what the passable cost field looks like, and which
      of that survives into each schedule's M_S. Those are properties of the
      scene and of the maps, and they are knowable before a query is posed.

The point of the separation is that a query chosen from this output is chosen
from the terrain, and a query chosen from an R(S) table is chosen from the
answer. Only the first one is evidence.

Window and lattice come from `eval_synthetic` by import, not by a second copy
of the constants, so what is surveyed here is the window the figure uses --
including the frame-count dependence, which is why `--frames` is the first
argument and is printed in the header.

--- what to read in the output ------------------------------------------

**IMPASSABLE, on M*.** The three geometric bits are the only ones that make a
cell a wall (§7.1, and `_cost_from_bits`'s "geometry decides, semantics
filters"). A query that does not have at least one of these between its start
and its goal is not asking the planner to decide anything, and R(S) along it
is measuring tie-breaking between equal-cost paths.

**PASSABLE COST SPREAD.** A wall is not the only kind of decision. A graded
cost field poses one too -- the cheapest route bends around expense rather
than around a hole -- and it is the kind that produces a *curve* rather than a
step. If every passable cell in the window costs `w_base`, the only decision
available is binary and the money plot cannot have a knee whatever the query.

**SURVIVES INTO M_S.** The claim the figure exists to make is that a coarse
map loses a feature a fine map keeps. That is visible here directly, per
schedule, without a planner: if every schedule marks the same cells
impassable, coarsening cost nothing on this scene and the flat curve is the
true answer rather than a badly-posed one.

**THE TWO SIDES OF eq. (23) ARE NOT ON THE SAME LATTICE.** This is what the
survey was built to check and it is what it found. `costmap_from_reference`
blocks M* down to `plan.cell_m` and applies §7.1 to the block means;
`costmap_from_gridmap` applies §7.1 at the MAP's cell size and samples the
result. §7.1's thresholds are not scale-invariant -- a step of `h` reads as a
gradient of `h / 2c` at cell size `c` -- so the same kerb is a wall on a 5 cm
map and flat ground on M*. Section 6 prints the crossing point across every
cell size in the sweep; section 3 prints what it does to the wall sets.

**CLASS IS ON ONLY ONE SIDE.** `costmap_from_reference` states that clearance
is absent from M* and why. Bit 4 (class) is absent too and that is not stated:
`ReferenceMap` carries `class_id`, but the reference costmap is built from
`block_stats` alone, which is heights. So M_S pays `w_class` on ground it
calls non-drivable and M* pays nothing anywhere. Any query whose alternative
routes differ in ground class -- road against verge, which on this scene means
any LATERAL query -- reads that asymmetry as regret. It is reported as its own
line because it decides whether a lateral reposition is available at all.
