"""The Day-4 headline figure: memory on x, plan regret on y. Math §8.2.

    python scripts/regret_plot.py [--frames 16] [--out docs/figures]

Gate 4 asks for this curve with at least four schedules on it. Gate 6 asks
that every number on a slide come from a script. This is that script: it runs
`eval_synthetic.py`'s sweep -- the same one, imported, not a second copy -- and
writes both the CSV of rows and the figure drawn from it, so the figure and
the table can never disagree.

The CSV is written whether or not matplotlib is installed. Numbers are the
deliverable; the picture is a rendering of them, and a missing plotting
library should not cost you the sweep.

⚑ **The curve this currently produces has no knee, and that is a finding
  rather than a bug in the plotting.** On the synthetic sequence R(S) is 0.000
  almost everywhere -- for both frozen schedules and for uniform 20, 40 and
  80 cm alike -- with a single non-monotone spike at uniform 10 cm. It is also
  frame-count dependent in a way a real result should not be: at 24 frames the
  two frozen schedules move to 0.207 while the three coarse uniforms stay at
  0.000, i.e. coarser maps scoring BETTER than ours, the opposite of the claim
  the figure exists to make. The diagnosis is in the planning
  query rather than in the metric: `eval_synthetic.PLAN_LANE_CELLS` runs the
  path down a fixed lane six cells off centre, and the hazards the terrain was
  built to contain -- the 12 cm kerbs at |y| = 3 m, the 40 cm pothole at
  (18, 0), the ramp from x = 30 m -- are not on it. Every schedule plans the
  same straight line, so R(S) is measuring tie-breaking between equal-cost
  paths rather than the cost of coarsening, and a fine map that resolves the
  pothole can be penalised for routing around something the coarse maps
  smooth away entirely.

  **I have deliberately not adjusted the query.** Changing the experiment
  after seeing which answer it gives is how a figure stops being evidence.
  Posing it properly -- a start and goal that require a decision about the
  kerb or the pothole -- is a change to `eval_synthetic.py`, which is Aakash's,
  and it should be agreed before it is made rather than tuned until the curve
  looks right.

  ---- 2026-09-01, Aakash: the numbers above have moved, and not by tuning ----

  The block above is left as written because its diagnosis is still right and
  still open. What changed underneath it is `eval/synthetic.py`'s beam-surface
  intersection, which had a sign error: the sensor's height above a surface at
  elevation z is `(h_s - z)` and the sampler used `(h_s + z)`. On flat ground
  they agree, so it survived every test the scene had. On the features it did
  not, and the consequence for this figure is specific: **across a whole
  sequence the old sampler returned not one point below -30 cm.** The 40 cm
  pothole -- the scene's only negative obstacle -- had never once been
  observed as a hole at any range, so "the hazards are not on the lane" was
  understating it. One of them was not in the map at all.

  I found this from a FOV assertion in `tests/test_loader_path.py`, before
  looking at any regret number, and the fix is forced by the geometry rather
  than chosen: `_beam_range` now solves the intersection instead of taking one
  step towards it. `PLAN_LANE_CELLS` and the rest of the query are untouched.

  ⚑ **Your finding stands. The curve is unchanged, and I briefly thought
  otherwise.** Putting the pothole into the map moves nothing here, for
  exactly the reason you gave: `PLAN_LANE_CELLS` runs the path six cells off
  the centreline and the pothole is ON the centreline. What did move R(S) --
  to 2.389, in the hour between the two fixes -- was a second and unrelated
  bug that the first one exposed: `grid/traversability.py` held a
  hand-written class table that was off by one for every class, so
  `drivable_classes` resolved to {parking, sidewalk, other-ground, building,
  pole}. Road was not drivable and a building wall was. It had been
  unreachable only because the synthetic scene wrote learning ids that landed
  inside the wrong table's drivable set by coincidence. Both are fixed and the
  table now comes from `configs/frnet.yaml`.

  So, `--frames 12` and `--frames 14`, with both fixes in:

      5_10_20_40    0.000      uniform_20cm   0.000
      5_10_50       0.000      uniform_40cm   0.000
      uniform_10cm  1.536      uniform_80cm   0.000

  which is your block above, to the third decimal, with the uniform-10 cm
  spike moving 1.389 -> 1.536. The frame-count dependence you flagged is also
  still there and is now larger, not smaller: at 24 frames the two frozen
  schedules go to **1.450** where they used to go to 0.207, while all four
  uniforms stay at 0.000. That window sits behind the vehicle at x = 35-46 m
  and so contains the ramp rather than the pothole, which is worth knowing
  before anyone reads the 24-frame number as being about the pothole.

  Nothing here has been resolved by the sampler fix and `PLAN_LANE_CELLS` is
  still untouched. Posing the query so it has to decide about the kerb or the
  pothole is still the open item, still yours to agree with me before either
  of us moves it.

Everything here is synthetic and none of it is reportable: the terrain is
analytic, so there is no sensor noise, no occlusion and no registration error.
The figure is stamped with that, in the figure itself, so a screenshot of it
cannot lose the caveat.
