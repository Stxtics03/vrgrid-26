## 1. Sensor sampling geometry — why the rings are what they are ⚑

This section is the physical justification for the entire representation. It is also, in its second half, the most original analysis in the project.

### 1.1 Azimuthal spacing — the easy axis

A LiDAR fires at fixed *angles*. Two consecutive returns in the same laser ring, at range `r`, are separated along the arc by

```
s_az(r) = r · Δθ                                                    (1)
```

Linear in range. With Δθ = 0.2°:

| r (m) | 10 | 25 | 50 | 100 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `s_az` (cm) | 3.5 | 8.7 | 17.5 | 34.9 |

Compare the schedule 5 / 10 / 20 / 40 cm. **Cell size tracks the sensor's own sample spacing to within a factor of 1.15 at every ring boundary.** This is a Nyquist-style argument: making cells finer than the sample spacing cannot add information, it only adds empty cells.

### 1.2 Radial ground spacing — the axis everybody forgets ⚑

The gap between where *consecutive laser rings* strike flat ground is a different beast. A beam at depression angle `φ` from a sensor at height `h_s` intersects the ground at

```
r = h_s / tan φ  ≈  h_s / φ     for small φ                         (2)
```

Differentiate:

```
dr/dφ = −h_s/φ²  = −h_s/(h_s/r)²  = −r²/h_s
```

so the radial spacing between adjacent beams is

```
s_rad(r) = (r² / h_s) · Δφ                                          (3)
```

**Quadratic in range.** This is the key result.

| r (m) | 10 | 25 | 50 | 80 | 100 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `s_rad` (m) | **0.43** | **2.69** | **10.77** | **27.6** | **43.1** |

At 50 m, consecutive laser rings land **10.8 metres apart** on the road.

### 1.3 The consequence: single-frame cell fill rate

A ground cell of size `c` at range `r` receives a return only if a laser ring passes through it *and* an azimuthal sample lands in it:

```
P_fill(r, c) ≈ min(1, c/s_rad(r)) · min(1, c/s_az(r))               (4)
```

| Ring | r | c | c/s_rad | c/s_az | **P_fill** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 10 m | 5 cm | 0.116 | 1.0 | **11.6%** |
| 1 | 25 m | 10 cm | 0.037 | 1.0 | **3.7%** |
| 2 | 50 m | 20 cm | 0.019 | 1.0 | **1.9%** |
| 3 | 100 m | 40 cm | 0.009 | 1.0 | **0.9%** |
| *uniform baseline* | 50 m | 5 cm | 0.005 | 0.29 | **0.13%** |

**Three conclusions, all reportable:**

1. **The uniform 5 cm baseline is 99.87% empty at 50 m.** Uniform high resolution at range is not high resolution — it is an empty array with a confident axis label. This is the strongest possible form of your central argument, and it is a derived number, not rhetoric.

2. **Coarsening improves fill rate by 15× at Ring 2.** Your cells are not merely smaller in count, they are individually *better supported by evidence*.

3. ⚑ **Rings 2–3 are filled by ego-motion, not by the sensor.** Since `P_fill < 2%` per frame, the far field is populated only as the vehicle drives forward and the ring pattern sweeps across the ground. Call this **ring-sweep filling**. It implies: temporal accumulation is the sole fill mechanism in the far field; single-frame far-field metrics are meaningless; and far-ring accuracy must be reported as a function of frames-since-first-observation, not as a scalar.

### 1.4 Derived limits (each of these is a scope statement in the report)

**Blind cone.** The lowest beam at depression `φ_min` (−24.8° for HDL-64E) strikes the ground at

```
r_blind = h_s / tan|φ_min| = 1.73 / tan(24.8°) = 3.74 m             (5)
```

Blind disc area `π r_blind² = 43.9 m²`; Ring 0 covers a 20×20 m square = 400 m². **11.0% of Ring 0 is unobservable in any single frame.** Mark unknown, never free. Report the persistent-unknown fraction separately, since ego-motion fills most of it.

**Negative obstacles.** A pothole of width `W` is sampled only if `W > s_rad(r)`. Inverting (3):

```
r_max(W) = √(W · h_s / Δφ)                                          (6)
```

| W | 30 cm | 50 cm | 1.0 m |
|---|---|---|---|
| `r_max` | **8.3 m** | **10.8 m** | **15.2 m** |

⚑ **This is now checked against the sampler rather than only derived.** The
synthetic scene's 60 cm pothole (`eval/synthetic.py`) is resolved — beams
return points at depth — from 8 m, and from 14 m and 16 m beams still land
inside its footprint but every one comes back at rim height. That is eq. (6)
doing what it says, and it is asserted in
`tests/test_synthetic_layout.py::test_the_pothole_is_resolved_near_and_invisible_far`.

Worth recording *why* it went unchecked until 2026-09-01: the sampler solved
the beam-ground intersection with one correction step that used `(h_s + z)`
where the sensor's height above a surface at elevation `z` is `(h_s − z)`. The
two agree exactly on flat ground, so nothing caught it, and on a feature they
disagree by about `2z/tan|φ|` — 1.7 m radially at the steepest beam. The
practical consequence was that **no return below −30 cm was produced at any
range in any frame**: the scene's only negative obstacle was never observed as
a hole at all. The intersection is now solved (`synthetic._beam_range`).

This did NOT move the §8.2 figure, and an earlier revision of this paragraph
said it did. R(S) is measured down a lane six cells off the centreline and the
pothole sits on the centreline, so putting it into the map changes no decision
there. What moved R(S) that day was a separate off-by-one in
`grid/traversability.py`'s class table, which the same commit exposed; both are
recorded in `docs/research-log.md` under 2026-09-01.

**Slow-motion detectability.** An object at speed `v` moves `d = v·Δt` between frames (Δt = 0.1 s at 10 Hz). It is *geometrically* detectable only if

```
v · Δt  >  max( c_L(r),  s_az(r),  3σ_r )                           (7)
```

A pedestrian at 1.4 m/s moves 14 cm/frame. That exceeds Ring 0 (5 cm) and Ring 1 (10 cm) but **not Ring 2 (20 cm)**. Solving `c_L(r) = v·Δt` puts the crossover at **≈ 25 m**. Beyond 25 m, pedestrian motion detection is a *semantic prior*, not a measurement. A car at 15 m/s moves 1.5 m/frame and is detectable in all rings.

**Unit test.** Assert `s_rad(50) / s_rad(25) ≈ 4` (quadratic scaling) and that `P_fill` computed empirically from a real scan matches (4) to within 20%.

## 2. The lattice — a proof of alignment, not a tolerance ⚑

The problem statement explicitly warns about "alignment errors or data loss during the projection." Most teams will handle this with an epsilon. You can *prove* it away.

### 2.1 Construction

Define one global integer lattice at the base resolution `c₀ = 5 cm`:

```
i_fine(x) = ⌊x / c₀⌋                                                (8)
```

Every coarser ring index is derived from it by integer division, never recomputed in floating point:

```
i_L(x) = ⌊ i_fine(x) / k_L ⌋ ,     k_L = c_L / c₀ ∈ ℤ⁺              (9)
```

For the default schedule `k = (1, 2, 4, 8)`; for the ablation `k = (1, 2, 10)`.

### 2.2 Theorem (Exact nesting)

> For any real `x`, any `c₀ > 0` and any integer `k ≥ 1`:
> ```
> ⌊ ⌊x/c₀⌋ / k ⌋  =  ⌊ x / (k c₀) ⌋
> ```

**Proof.** Let `m = ⌊⌊x/c₀⌋/k⌋`. Then `mk ≤ ⌊x/c₀⌋ < (m+1)k`. Since `mk` and `(m+1)k` are integers and `⌊x/c₀⌋` is the greatest integer `≤ x/c₀`, the left inequality gives `mk ≤ x/c₀`, and the right gives `x/c₀ < (m+1)k` (if `x/c₀ ≥ (m+1)k` then `⌊x/c₀⌋ ≥ (m+1)k`, contradiction). Hence `m ≤ x/(kc₀) < m+1`, i.e. `m = ⌊x/(kc₀)⌋`. ∎

*(This is the nested-floor identity, Graham, Knuth & Patashnik,* Concrete Mathematics*, eq. 3.11.)*

### 2.3 Corollary (Partition)

The ring-`L` lattice is **exactly** the direct lattice of cell size `k_L c₀`. Therefore the ring cells form a partition of the plane: every point lands in exactly one cell, never zero, never two. **There is no tolerance to tune, no epsilon, and no boundary case.**

Contrast with the naive implementation, computing `⌊x/c_L⌋` independently per ring in IEEE-754 from a decimal literal. The ring lattice is then built on `fl(c_L)`, a different real number from the `k_L·fl(c₀)` that `k_L` fine cells actually span, so the two lattices drift apart and near a boundary you get points that fall in both cells or in neither.

> **Correction, 28 Aug — Aakash.** *This paragraph previously named `⌊x/0.20⌋` and `⌊x/0.40⌋` as the counterexample. Those are exactly the two values where the naive code is **accidentally correct**, so as written the section was arguing its case from the one family of examples that does not support it. The claim is right; the numbers were wrong. Corrected here and in §2.4(b). Nothing about (8), (9), the theorem or its proof changes.*

**Where the drift actually bites — and why the default schedule hides it.** `fl(c₀)` = 3602879701896397/2⁵⁶, slightly greater than 1/20. Multiplying a double by 2^m is exact, so for `k = 2^m` the quantity `k·fl(c₀)` is representable and `fl(c_L)` **is** that same double: the naive lattice coincides with the derived one exactly. The default schedule's ratios are 1, 2, 4, 8 — all powers of two — so a naive implementation passes every test you run against `5/10/20/40` and is genuinely bit-identical there.

It fails on the ablation. For `k = 10`, `k·fl(c₀)` = 0.5000000000000000277… is **not** representable and rounds to exactly 0.5, so a ring cell of the naive lattice is a hair narrower than the ten fine cells it is supposed to contain. The double 0.5 lies in fine cell 9 — ring cell 0 — while the naive lattice calls it ring cell 1:

```
x = 0.5, k = 10:   ⌊i_fine(x)/k⌋ = ⌊9/10⌋   = 0     ← derived, and correct
                   ⌊x / (k·c₀)⌋  = ⌊0.5/0.5⌋ = 1     ← naive, off by one
```

This is not one unlucky value. It is **every** positive boundary of the naive lattice: 4000 of 4000 out to 200 m, and the same for `k = 5` and `k = 20`. The failure is one-sided — the naive cell is narrower than the fine cells it should contain, so on the negative side the flooring absorbs the shortfall and the two agree.

Note *where* it is not: at ±4 ulps around each of those 4000 boundaries, 72,009 probes in total, the only disagreements are at the boundary doubles themselves — 4000 of them, zero in the neighbourhood. The defect has measure zero. **That is what makes it dangerous, not what makes it safe.** No amount of uniform random sampling will find it, which is why the test specified in §2.4(b) has to compare against exact arithmetic rather than against a second float computation, and why this went unnoticed long enough to reach a frozen document. A LiDAR return at exactly 0.5 m, 1.0 m or 1.5 m is not exotic. Recorded as `test_direct_float_lattice_disagrees_at_ring_boundaries`.

**Why powers of two are convenient but not required.** For `k = 2^m`, equation (9) is a bit-shift `i_fine >> m`. For any other integer (e.g. `k=10` in the ablation schedule) it is an integer divide. Both are exact. The validator must therefore check **integer ratio**, not power-of-two.

Note that the power-of-two case is doubly special: it is also the case where the float shortcut is safe. That is precisely why equation (9) is not optional. Written the naive way, this project would ship a lattice that is provably correct on the schedule it was developed against and silently off by one cell on the schedule it is compared to — and the ablation is where the memory claim is made.

### 2.4 Map shifting — O(perimeter), not O(area)

The map follows the vehicle by toroidal (wrap-around) indexing. Ring `L` of extent `N_L × N_L` cells is addressed as

```
addr(i, j) = ( (i + o_L^x) mod N_L ,  (j + o_L^y) mod N_L )         (10)
```

Shifting by one cell increments the offset and clears only the newly exposed strip: **`2N_L` cells cleared, not `N_L²`.** For Ring 3 (`N = 500`), that is 1,000 cells instead of 250,000 — the difference between a sub-millisecond shift and a 40 ms stall.

**Constraint:** the map origin must move in whole **coarsest**-cell steps (40 cm), otherwise every ring boundary shifts by a fraction and you must resample — which is precisely the "data loss during projection" the brief warns about. Expected side effect: the nominal 25 m ring boundary wobbles by up to 40 cm. That is correct behaviour, not a bug.

**Unit test.** Generate 10⁶ random points, seeded — a CI-blocking gate must fail reproducibly or not at all. Assert:

**(a)** each point maps to exactly one cell per ring. Anchor existence at the index actually returned: `i·k ≤ i_fine < (i+1)·k`, then assert that neither neighbour also contains it. Counting how many of `{i−1, i, i+1}` contain the point is **not** sufficient — the cells are disjoint by construction, so that count is 1 even when `i` is off by one, and a truncating implementation passes.

**(b)** `i_L` computed by (9) equals the true index of the size-`k_L c₀` lattice, evaluated in **exact rational arithmetic** — `⌊Fraction(x) / (Fraction(c₀)·k_L)⌋` — not as `⌊x/(k_L c₀)⌋` in floating point. The theorem in §2.2 is a statement about reals, and `k_L c₀` is itself a rounded double; evaluating the right-hand side in floats measures that rounding, not the theorem, and for `k = 10` it is false at every boundary (§2.3). Exact arithmetic is slow, so run it on a 2·10⁴ subsample and keep the full 10⁶ for (a), which is pure integer work.

**(c)** shifting the map by +1 then −1 cell restores every cell value identically.

**(d)** run (a) and (b) against **both** frozen schedules. `5/10/20/40` is all powers of two and cannot catch a lattice bug that only appears at non-power-of-two ratios; `5/10/50` is what exercises `k = 10`.

*(b) and (d) revised 28 Aug — see the correction in §2.3.*

## 3. Per-cell height estimation — Kalman with a range-dependent measurement model

### 3.1 Why a Kalman filter and not a running mean

A running mean weights every measurement equally. But a point returned at 80 m at grazing incidence is dramatically less informative about elevation than one at 5 m head-on, and averaging them equally throws away that structure. The Kalman filter is the minimum-variance linear estimator when measurement variances differ — which is exactly our situation. This is the standard elevation-mapping formulation (Fankhauser et al.).

### 3.2 The measurement variance model

A point's height is `z = r sin φ`. Propagating range noise `σ_r` and angular noise `σ_φ` through first-order error propagation:

```
∂z/∂r = sin φ ,      ∂z/∂φ = r cos φ

σ²_z = sin²φ · σ²_r  +  r² cos²φ · σ²_φ                             (11)
```

For a beam striking the ground, `φ` is small, so `sin φ ≈ h_s/r` and `cos φ ≈ 1`:

```
σ²_z ≈ (h_s/r)² σ²_r  +  r² σ²_φ                                    (12)
```

The **second term dominates at range and grows as `r²`.** With `σ_φ = 0.1°`: σ_z = 8.7 cm at 50 m, 17.5 cm at 100 m. The first term is the near-field floor.

**Incidence-angle inflation.** On a surface whose normal makes angle `θ_inc` with the beam, a lateral positioning error maps into height error amplified by `1/cos θ_inc`. Grazing hits on the road at range are the worst case:

```
σ²_z(r, φ, θ_inc) = [ sin²φ σ²_r + r² cos²φ σ²_φ ] / cos²θ_inc      (13)
```

Clamp `cos θ_inc ≥ 0.1` to avoid a singularity at pure grazing.

### 3.3 The scalar update

```
K   = σ²_prior / (σ²_prior + σ²_z)                                  (14)
μ  ← μ + K (z − μ)
σ² ← (1 − K) σ²_prior
```

Add process noise each frame to model pose drift and terrain change: `σ² ← σ² + q Δt`, with `q` small (≈ 10⁻⁴ m²/s). Without it, `σ²` collapses toward zero and the cell stops responding to new evidence — the classic filter-lock failure.

### 3.4 Fixed-point accumulation and determinism

IEEE-754 addition is **not associative**: `(a+b)+c ≠ a+(b+c)` in general. GPU atomic float adds complete in nondeterministic order, so two identical runs produce different maps. That breaks debugging (you cannot bisect a bug whose location moves) and quietly invalidates any lossless claim.

Since heights are quantised to 1 cm anyway, accumulate in **int32 fixed-point**. Integer addition is exactly associative, so results are bit-identical run to run.

**Quantisation error budget.** Uniform quantisation with step `q` has variance `q²/12`. For `q = 1 cm`: `σ_quant = 2.9 mm`. Compare to (12): σ_z ≈ 8 mm at 5 m, 87 mm at 50 m. Quantisation is **≤ 1/3 of sensor noise at the closest range and negligible beyond**, and a 12 cm kerb resolves into 12 levels. int16 at 1 cm spans ±327 m. **1 cm is justified, not a default.**

> **Implementation note, 29 Aug — Aakash. The height-variance codec, which §3 needs and no section defines.** *`cell.height_variance` is a uint8 marked "log-quantised" with no scheme attached, so nothing in §3 could be built until one existed. Written as `src/grid/quantise.py`; three decisions worth ratifying because each changes behaviour.*
>
> ***Code 0 is MAXIMUM variance, not minimum.*** *`allocate()` zeros every field and the ego-motion shift zeros each newly exposed strip, so 0 is the state of every cell never looked at and every cell that just scrolled into view. If 0 decoded to the smallest variance the map would boot claiming millimetre certainty about ground it has never seen — and worse, the first Kalman gain would be ≈ 0, so the cell would never recover. Zeroed memory now means "I know nothing", the same convention as `OCC_UNKNOWN = 0`.*
>
> ***The floor is q²/12 = 0.083 cm², the paragraph above.*** *σ² below the storage step is a claim the storage cannot express, and a filter allowed to reach zero locks — the same argument as §3.3's process noise, from the storage side.* ***The ceiling is (8 m)²***, *the vertical extent.*
>
> ***Rounding is toward the larger variance*** *(floor in code space), so a stored value is always ≥ the true one and a decreasing variance can never round back up. That is what keeps this section's monotonicity test true through the codec rather than in spite of it.*
>
> *Resolution: 255 codes over a range of 7.7×10⁶, so one code is a factor of **1.064** — 6.4% in variance, 3.2% in σ. ⚑ Consequence for §5: Theorem 1's strict inflation is only* observable *in the stored map when the slope term clears 6.4%. Measured, for a cell settled to σ = 3 cm on a 20% slope: ring 1 (10→5 cm) +2.1%, invisible; ring 2 (20→10 cm) +8.3%, visible; ring 3 (40→20 cm) +33%, visible. The theorem is untouched — what is quantised is the evidence for it — but a demo that shows variance rising on refinement must not be built on ring 1.*

**Unit test.** Run the same sequence twice; assert byte-identical map hashes. Assert `σ²` decreases monotonically under repeated consistent measurements and increases under process noise alone.

## 4. Merge — the law of total variance ⚑

**This is a correction to plan v2, which called merging "standard, uncontroversial."**

### 4.1 Why inverse-variance fusion is the wrong tool

Inverse-variance fusion, `1/σ²_fused = Σ 1/σ²_i`, is the maximum-likelihood combination of **repeated measurements of one quantity**. Four child cells are not four measurements of one height — they are measurements of **four different places**. Merging them is *marginalisation over a footprint*.

The failure is not academic. Applied naively to four children straddling a kerb — say heights 0.00, 0.00, 0.12, 0.12 m, each with σ = 2 cm — inverse-variance fusion returns σ = 1 cm. **The merged cell claims to be twice as certain as any child, while sitting on top of a 12 cm step it has just erased.** Your map becomes most confident exactly where it is least justified.

### 4.2 The correct rule

Model the parent as the distribution of surface height over its footprint — a mixture of the children. By the law of total variance:

```
μ_p  = Σ w_i μ_i                                                    (15)

σ²_p = Σ w_i σ²_i        +   Σ w_i (μ_i − μ_p)²                     (16)
       └─ within-cell ─┘      └─── between-cell ───┘
         E[Var(z|child)]         Var(E[z|child])
```

with weights `w_i = n_i / Σ n_j` (observation counts), or uniform if counts are equal.

The second term is what naive fusion discards. On the kerb example, (16) gives `σ²_p = 0.0004 + 0.0036`, so **σ_p = 6.3 cm** — six times the naive answer, and correctly reflecting that the cell now spans a step.

### 4.3 Corollary

```
σ²_p ≥ Σ w_i σ²_i  ≥  min_i σ²_i
```

**Merging never decreases variance below the average child variance, and increases it strictly whenever the children disagree.** Combined with §5 this gives the symmetry for the slide: *variance rises on split because we assert detail we never measured; variance rises on merge because we hide detail we did measure.* Both directions are honest.

**Unit test.** Four children with identical means → `σ²_p = Σw σ²_i` exactly (between-term vanishes). Four children on a synthetic step of height `Δ` → `σ²_p ≥ Δ²/4`.

---

## 5. Split — variance inflation and the round-trip theorem ⚑

This is the mathematically distinctive core of the project.

### 5.1 The problem

Splitting a parent of size `c_p` into four children of size `c_c = c_p/2`, we know `(μ_p, σ²_p)` and nothing else. The children must be assigned values. The mean is forced: with no information distinguishing them, `μ_i = μ_p` for all `i` (any other assignment invents structure).

The variance is the interesting question. **Setting `σ²_i = σ²_p` is wrong** — not because it under-reports the magnitude of uncertainty, but because it misrepresents its *structure*. Four children carrying `μ_p` are perfectly correlated, yet every downstream consumer will treat them as four independent finer estimates. The map asserts resolution it does not possess.

### 5.2 The inflation term

Model the ground locally as a plane with gradient `∇z` estimated by finite differences over the parent's neighbours (§7.1). A child centre sits at offset `d = c_p/4` from the parent centre, so the true child mean differs from `μ_p` by approximately `∇z · d`. Adding a roughness term `α` for sub-cell terrain variability:

```
σ²_child = σ²_parent  +  κ ‖∇z‖² (c_p² − c_c²)  +  α                (17)
                         └──────── slope term ────────┘
```

with `κ = 1/16` from the offset geometry (`d² = c_p²/16`) and `α` calibrated against the reference map (§9).

> **Note, 28 Aug — Aakash. `κ = 1/16` does not follow from the geometry it cites, and the correct constant is `1/12`.** *Not applied: κ is frozen in `configs/thresholds.yaml` and changing it is a room decision. Both values are pinned in `test_kappa_from_geometry_is_one_twelfth_at_every_ratio` so the choice stays visible. No theorem changes either way.*
>
> *The offset geometry is right — a child centre of a 2×2 split sits `c_p/4` off the parent centre on each axis, so `d² = c_p²/16`. But (17) multiplies κ by `(c_p² − c_c²)`, not by `c_p²`. At `c_c = c_p/2` that factor is `(3/4)c_p²`, so `κ = 1/16` delivers `3c_p²/64` where the stated geometry asks for `4c_p²/64` — a uniform 25% under-inflation. Setting `κ = 1/12` reproduces the geometry exactly.*

**Generalisation to `m × m`, which the ablation needs.** §5.1 and §5.2 are written for `c_c = c_p/2`, i.e. four children. `5/10/50` refines **5×** between rings 1 and 2, so a split there produces **25** children. (17) already handles this and the merge rule of §4.2 is stated for an arbitrary number of children, so nothing needs rewriting — but two things are worth stating rather than leaving to be rediscovered:

- The mean-square child-centre offset per axis for an `m × m` split is `c_p²(m² − 1)/(12m²)`, which is exactly `(c_p² − c_c²)/12`. So (17)'s `(c_p² − c_c²)` form is the **m-independent** one, and the geometric κ above is `1/12` at every ratio — not a per-schedule constant. The `m = 2` case, `d² = c_p²/16`, is the special case, not the general rule.
- Consequently the 25% shortfall from `κ = 1/16` is the same 25% at `m = 2` and `m = 5`. One constant to decide, once.

`split()` reads `m` from the schedule rather than assuming four. `test_split_follows_the_schedule_not_the_number_four` asserts 4 children across `10 → 5` and 25 across `50 → 10`.

### 5.3 Theorem 1 (Variance monotonicity)

> For `c_c < c_p` and `‖∇z‖ > 0`, `σ²_child > σ²_parent` strictly.

Immediate from (17), since `c_p² − c_c² > 0`. **Limiting behaviour is correct:** on a perfectly flat road `∇z = 0` and splitting costs nothing — which is right, because splitting a flat surface genuinely loses no information.

> **Note, 28 Aug — Aakash. The flat-ground limit above, and §5.4 unit test (c), are true only for `α = 0`.** *(17) adds `α` unconditionally, so any `α > 0` charges for splitting flat ground and both statements become false. Theorem 1 itself survives — `α > 0` only strengthens a strict inequality — which is exactly why this is easy to walk past.*
>
> *`α` is `0.0` in `configs/thresholds.yaml` today, which is honest rather than convenient: §5.2 calibrates it against the reference map and the reference map is blocked on the download. **Whoever calibrates `α` must restate this paragraph and rewrite unit test (c) in the same commit.** `test_alpha_would_break_the_flat_ground_remark` fails the moment `α` moves, so the commit cannot be a quiet one.*

### 5.4 Theorem 2 (Round-trip idempotence) — and why it needs one bit

Naively, split-then-merge does **not** return the original. Substituting `μ_i = μ_p` into (16): the between-term vanishes, so `σ²_merged = σ²_child = σ²_p + Δ > σ²_p`. Variance has been inflated by a no-op.

This is a real bug, not a formality. A cell oscillating across a ring boundary while the vehicle changes speed would inflate its variance *every frame*, and the map would drift toward uncertainty without any physical cause. (This is also why §6.3's hysteresis matters.)

**Fix:** one `derived` bit in the cell's flags byte, set on split, cleared by any new measurement. Merge rule:

```
if all four children derived AND no observations since split:
        restore (μ_p, σ²_p) exactly            ← inverse of split
else:
        apply law of total variance (16)       ← genuine marginalisation
```

> **Theorem 2.** With the `derived` flag, `merge(split(c)) = c` exactly, in both mean and variance, when no measurement intervenes.

**Proof.** Split sets `μ_i = μ_p` (mean preserved by construction) and marks all children derived. With no intervening measurement, the merge branch restores `σ²_p` by definition. ∎

> **Implementation note, 28 Aug — Aakash. "Restores `σ²_p`" has to mean *reads it back*, not *recomputes it*, and that is a constraint on the map layout.** *The proof is a statement about reals and is not in question; this is about what makes it hold in float64.*
>
> *Deflating — `σ²_p = σ²_child − Δ` — is exact in real arithmetic and is not exact in IEEE-754. It is worst precisely where the map is best: a confident cell (`σ²_p ≈ 10⁻⁶ m²`) split on a slope (`Δ ≈ 10⁻² m²`) loses most of its significant digits in the subtraction and does not come back bit-identical. "Bit-identical" in unit test (a) is the right requirement — a round trip accurate to 10⁻¹² per cycle is still unbounded drift over a sequence at 10 Hz, which is the drift §5.4 exists to eliminate.*
>
> *So the restore branch returns the parent value rather than computing anything, which is available because **split does not destroy the parent**: it writes children into the finer ring / refinement pool while the ring-`L` cell stays resident in its own buffer. ⚑ **If a future SoA split reuses the parent's slot, Theorem 2 stops being exact.** Recorded here because it is invisible at the call site and cheap to break.*

Cost: one bit. Return: split and merge form an exact inverse pair, provable and testable.

**Unit test.** (a) Random cell → split → merge → assert bit-identical mean and variance. (b) Split on a synthetic slope → assert `σ²_child > σ²_parent` for every child. (c) Split on flat ground → assert `σ²_child = σ²_parent`. (d) Split → inject one measurement into one child → merge → assert the result now follows (16), not the restore path.

## 6. Ring assignment, anisotropy and hysteresis

### 6.1 Isotropic base

Rings are square annuli, so ring membership uses the Chebyshev (L∞) norm:

```
d(x, y) = max(|x|, |y|)
L(x, y) = min { L : d(x,y) < R_L }                                  (18)
```

Cell count for square annulus `L` follows directly:

```
N_L = 4 (R_L² − R_{L−1}²) / c_L²                                    (19)
```

| L | `R_{L−1}→R_L` | `c_L` | `N_L` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 → 10 | 0.05 | 160,000 |
| 1 | 10 → 25 | 0.10 | 210,000 |
| 2 | 25 → 50 | 0.20 | 187,500 |
| 3 | 50 → 100 | 0.40 | 187,500 |
| | | **Σ** | **745,000** |

Ablation (5/10/50): `160,000 + 210,000 + 4(100²−25²)/0.25 = 520,000`.

### 6.2 Anisotropic foveation

Circular foveation wastes resolution behind the vehicle. In the vehicle frame (`x` forward, `y` left), replace (18) with a scaled L∞ norm:

```
d_aniso = max( x⁺/a_f(v),  x⁻/a_r,  |y|/a_s(v) )                    (20)

a_f(v) = clamp(1 + κ_f v/v_ref,  1,  2)      forward stretch
a_s(v) = 1 / (1 + κ_s v/v_ref)                lateral squeeze
a_r    = 1                                    rear never stretched
```

subject to a hard rear floor: `c_L ≤ 0.20 m` whenever `x < 0 ∧ |x| < 50`.

⚑ **Alignment is preserved, and this is not obvious.** Equation (20) changes which *ring* a cell belongs to; it does not change the *lattice*. Every cell at every ring remains a `k_L`-fold aggregate of the same base 5 cm lattice, so §2's partition theorem is untouched. State this explicitly — it looks like it should break alignment, and a reviewer may assume it does.

### 6.3 Hysteresis — mandatory, not optional

A cell sitting exactly on a ring boundary while `v` fluctuates will split and merge every frame. Consequences: refinement-pool thrash, and (by §5.4) unbounded variance inflation if the `derived` flag is ever cleared mid-cycle. Use asymmetric thresholds:

```
split  when  d_aniso < R_L
merge  when  d_aniso > R_L (1 + ε)          ε ≈ 0.1                 (21)
```

**Unit test.** Drive a synthetic trajectory with sinusoidal speed across a ring boundary; assert the number of split/merge events per cell is bounded and that variance does not grow monotonically over 1,000 frames.

---

## 7. Traversability and the conservative pyramid ⚑

### 7.1 The predicate

Traversability is a **bitfield**, not a scalar — six independent conditions that fail for different reasons and that a planner should be able to distinguish:

```
bit 0  clearance   ceiling − ground  <  h_vehicle
bit 1  slope       ‖∇z‖              >  tan(θ_max)
bit 2  step        max|z_c − z_nbr|  >  s_max
bit 3  roughness   σ²                >  σ²_max
bit 4  class       class ∉ drivable_set
bit 5  confidence  n                 <  n_min          (fail safe)
```

Gradient by central differences over the four neighbours, differenced over a **fixed physical baseline** `b` rather than over one cell:

```
k_L  = max(1, round(b / (2 c_L)))                                   (22a)
∂z/∂x ≈ (z_{i+k,j} − z_{i−k,j}) / (2 k_L c_L)                       (22)
```

`b` is `traversability.baseline_m`. With `b ≤ 2 c_L` this is `k_L = 1` and (22) is the one-cell form the section was originally written with.

> **Note, 2 Sep — Shrestha. Why (22) is differenced over a distance and not over a cell.**
>
> *One cell is not a fixed baseline, so eq. (22) as first written measured height change per metre **at the cell scale**. A step discontinuity therefore reads steeper the finer the lattice: §4.1's 12 cm kerb is a gradient of 1.200 at 5 cm, 0.600 at 10 cm, 0.300 at 20 cm and 0.240 at 25 cm — against one frozen `tan(θ_max) = 0.364`. The same physical kerb was a **wall on the fine rings and flat ground on the coarse ones and on M\***, which is one of the two ways the sides of eq. (23) came to be evaluated on different geometry. Bit 2 scaled the other way for the same reason: on a constant grade the per-neighbour step grows with the cell, so a coarse map calls a ramp a kerb. Both bits now read over `b`.*
>
> ***`b` is bounded by the scene, not chosen by taste.*** *It must be large enough that the 12 cm kerb reads passable everywhere — `b > 0.12/tan(θ_max) = 0.33 m` — and small enough that the 40 cm pothole rim still fails — `b < 0.40/tan(θ_max) = 1.10 m`. `b = 0.50 m` is the middle of that window. The bound is on the **span** `2 k_L c_L`, not on `b`: a ring coarser than `b/2` falls back to `k_L = 1` and spans `2 c_L`, so at 80 cm the span is 1.60 m, past the bound, and a 40 cm hazard stops firing. That is a real limit of the coarse rings — `uniform_80cm` already carried zero impassable cells because a 60 cm hole does not survive an 80 cm cell — and it is asserted in `test_the_pothole_rim_still_fails_wherever_the_lattice_can_resolve_it` rather than left to be discovered.*
>
> ***The stencil is clipped, not wrapped, and the border rule is unchanged.*** *Near the window edge the stencil shortens and the divisor shortens with it, so the quotient stays a gradient in m/m rather than one scaled by a distance that was never spanned. Only the outermost cell of each edge is one-sided, and it still carries bit 5 by the rule below. Widening the border mask to `k_L` cells was rejected: at 5 cm that is a 5-cell border, ~5% of a ring, and inflating the confidence bit is the very confound §8.2's `w_unknown` accounting had just been fixed for.*
>
> ⚑ ***On the synthetic scene this changes no R(S).*** *There, M_S is already blocked down to `plan.cell_m` before §7.1 is applied, so both sides were at 25 cm and `k_L = 1` either way. What it fixes is the **map's own** traversability layer, where a fine ring called a kerb a wall and a coarse ring did not — the layer the dashboard, ghost removal and the per-ring table all read, and the one that reaches the planner on 07/08. Expect the effect on real data, not on the synthetic sweep.*

⚑ **Geometry decides, semantics filters.** A road with a 40 cm pothole has class `road` and is not drivable; a packed grass verge has class `vegetation` and often is. Class is one bit among six, not the decision.

> **Note, 29 Aug — Aakash. Two things (22) needs that the section does not give it, plus a class that does not fit.**
>
> ***Neighbours stop at the ring window.*** *A central difference needs both neighbours. Rings are stored as `side × side` toroidal squares, so rolling the array wraps the far edge of the map onto the near one — a cell on the north edge would take its gradient against ground 100 m south. The border ring of cells therefore carries **bit 5 (confidence)** rather than a fabricated gradient: fail safe is already the rule for "not enough evidence", and an invented slope at the map edge is exactly the kind of plausible number that survives review.*
>
> ***Cross-ring neighbours are not computed.*** *A cell on the inner edge of ring 2 has neighbours in ring 1, at half the cell size. Resolving it means resampling across a ring boundary for a two-cell strip and interacts with both rings' toroidal offsets. Not done; the strip is caught by the border rule above, which is conservative in the right direction. **The ring seams are the one place the traversability layer is coarser than the map** — say so in the report rather than leaving it to be found.*
>
> ✔ ***`terrain` is drivable, and it fits now.*** *`configs/thresholds.yaml` lists five drivable classes; `terrain` is learning id **17**, and with the old 4-bit class nibble one of the five classes this predicate consults on every cell could not be stored in the map at all. Resolved 1 Sep by the 5 | 3 re-split (§10.2). Worth keeping on the record because of how it read while it was broken: the predicate ran on every cell, consulted a class the cell could never hold, and produced a complete, plausible traversability layer — and because the eval harness's `% 16` stand-in mapped `terrain` onto `car`, which is not drivable, so the failure was not "terrain is missing" but "verges are marked impassable".* This is what the problem statement's Requirement 1 actually asks for, and it is also *evidence for* the grid: slope and step are finite differences over neighbours, which are trivial on a grid and effectively impossible on a raw point cloud without first building one.

### 7.2 The conservative pyramid

Build a 4-ary pyramid over each ring storing, per block `B`:

```
H_max(B) = max ground        H_min(B) = min ground
C_min(B) = min ceiling       n_min(B) = min observation count
AND_mask(B) = ⋀ traversability bitfields
```

**Not means.** Averaging heights hides hazards: a coarse cell straddling a kerb reports the mean and looks flat. Max/min preserves the worst case.

### 7.3 Theorem 3 (No false negatives)

> Define
> ```
> SAFE(B) ⟺ H_max(B) − H_min(B) < s_max
>          ∧ C_min(B) − H_max(B) > h_vehicle
>          ∧ n_min(B) ≥ n_min_threshold
> ```
> If `SAFE(B)` then **every** cell in `B` is traversable on conditions 0, 2 and 5.

**Proof.** For any cell `c ∈ B`, its clearance is `C(c) − H(c) ≥ C_min(B) − H_max(B) > h_vehicle`, satisfying bit 0. For any pair `c, c' ∈ B`, `|H(c) − H(c')| ≤ H_max(B) − H_min(B) < s_max`, satisfying bit 2. And `n(c) ≥ n_min(B) ≥ threshold`, satisfying bit 5. ∎

Symmetrically, if `AND_mask(B)` has bit `k` set, **every** cell fails condition `k`, so the block is certainly blocked. Otherwise the block is MIXED and the query descends one level.

**Result:** coarse queries are cheap *and* safe. You pay fine resolution only where the coarse answer is genuinely ambiguous, and a false "traversable" is impossible by construction.

**Cost.** A 4-ary pyramid over `N` cells adds `N(1/4 + 1/16 + …) = N/3`. Built over ground, ceiling and the traversability byte (5 bytes of the 12): `745,000 × 5 / 3 ≈ 1.24 MB`.

> **Implementation note, 29 Aug — Shrestha. The cost figure is low by about half, and the pyramid needs one field §7.2 does not list.** *Built as `src/gpu/pyramid.py`; three things to ratify, because two of them change a number and one changes what a caller is allowed to conclude.*
>
> ***The cost is 2.73 MB, not 1.24 MB.*** *Two independent errors, and they compound. A node does not store the source fields, it stores the* reductions*: ground contributes* both *`H_max` and `H_min`, so it is 4 bytes and not 2, and `n_min` adds a fifth — **8 bytes per node by §7.2's own list**, before anything is added. And `N` is the ring* windows*, which are the 910,000 allocated slots, not the 745,000 logical cells: the pyramid is built over what is stored, and §2.4 stores full squares. `910,000 × 9 / 3 = 2.73 MB`, measured by `pyramid_bytes()` and pinned in a test. The `N/3` claim itself is exactly right — measured ratio 3.00.*
>
> ***`OR_mask` is added, for 1 byte per node.*** *Without it the only available notion of SAFE is Theorem 3's, which covers bits 0, 2 and 5 —* three of the six*. A uniformly steep bank has every cell clear on clearance, step and confidence, so Theorem 3 reports SAFE while every cell fails bit 1, and a planner reading that as "drivable" drives onto the bank. `OR_mask == 0` says every cell is traversable on* all six*, which is what `api.QueryLOD.SAFE` already promises its callers. Theorem 3 is untouched and is still tested exactly as §7.3 states it; it keeps its own name, `theorem3_safe()`, so the weaker claim can never be mistaken for the stronger one.*
>
> ***Levels halve by ceiling, not floor.*** *Ring windows are 400 and 500 cells across and neither is a power of two. Floor-halving 500 gives 250, 125, **62** — silently dropping the last row and column of a 125-wide level, at the map edge, where nothing looks wrong. Ceiling-halving means edge blocks are 1 cell wide rather than 2, which is a correct reduction over a block of one. The partition property (exactly one block per cell per level) is asserted the same way §2.4(a) asserts it for the lattice.*
>
> *Measured, 910,000 slots: rebuild p50 **2.45 ms** / p99 3.10 ms, 32× headroom at 10 Hz, zero allocation per frame. Numbers from `scripts/bench_pyramid.py`. **Not switched on by default** — it takes the preallocated total from 29.06 MB to 32.17 MB, and that is a gate-review decision, not mine.*

**Unit test.** Exhaustive: for 10⁴ random blocks, if `SAFE(B)` then assert every constituent cell is individually traversable. Any counterexample is a proof failure, not a tuning issue.

## 8. Plan sensitivity — coarsening measured in units of decision ⚑

The headline contribution. Every adaptive-mapping paper measures reconstruction error; reconstruction error is a *proxy* for what matters. This measures the thing itself.

### 8.1 The offline metric

Let `M*` be the reference map (5 cm, no LOD, offline-aggregated). Let a planner `P` produce path `π_S = P(M_S)` on the map under schedule `S`, and `π* = P(M*)`. Define the path cost functional `J_M(π) = Σ_{c ∈ π} w_M(c) · Δℓ`, with `w` derived from the traversability bitfield.

```
Plan regret:   R(S) = J_{M*}(π_S) − J_{M*}(π*)   ≥ 0                (23)
```

⚑ **The critical detail: both paths are scored on `M*`.** Scoring `π_S` on `M_S` measures self-consistency, not quality — a badly coarsened map will happily report that its own bad plan is cheap. Non-negativity of (23) follows because `π*` minimises `J_{M*}` by construction.

Report alongside a purely geometric measure, the discrete Fréchet distance `d_F(π_S, π*)`, which catches the case where a detour costs the same but goes somewhere quite different.

> **⚑⚑ Note, 29 Aug — Aakash. Three things eq. (23) needs that §8 does not give it. The third one can reverse the headline.**
>
> **(a) `w` is undefined.** §8.1 says "`w` derived from the traversability bitfield" and stops. Derived in `src/eval/plan_regret.py`, numbers in `configs/thresholds.yaml` under `plan:`. The split follows §7.1: clearance, slope and step are **impassable** (the vehicle cannot), roughness and class are **weights** (it would rather not). Geometry decides, semantics filters — now as numbers.
>
> **(b) Unknown cannot be impassable here, and that is a real concession.** Everywhere else in this project unknown fails safe. For a planner that rule makes R(S) *undefined*: at `P_fill < 2%` per frame most of the far field has never been observed, so no path exists for any schedule. Unknown is therefore passable at price `w_unknown`, and the fraction of each path crossing it is reported beside R(S). **Zero regret along a mostly-unknown path means the sequence was too short to fill the map, not that the coarsening was free.**
>
> **(c) ⚑ R(S) compared across schedules measures FILL RATE, not coarsening, unless it is restricted to ground every schedule observed.** Measured on the synthetic scene, one 11 × 11 m window: `5/10/20/40` scored **5.803** against uniform-20 cm's **0.146** — read naively, forty times worse. Nothing was impassable in either map. The 5 cm ring holds few returns per cell, so 65% of its cells sat below `n_min` against the uniform grid's 4%, paid `w_unknown`, and the planner routed around a map that was merely *sparse*. **A finer schedule is penalised for resolving finely, and the effect is large enough to reverse the result.** `common_support()` restricts both maps to cells every schedule observed; with it the same comparison reads 1.793 against 0.146 and the unknown fraction is 0%. Any ablation quoting R(S) without the unknown fraction beside it is not interpretable.
>
> **And one that is not a §8 defect but bites here first:** a planning cell must AGGREGATE over its footprint, not sample the map at its centre. A 25 cm planning cell over a 5 cm ring covers 25 map cells and at ring-0 fill rates the centre is usually a gap between beam tracks, so centre-sampling shows a map that is mostly holes — worse the finer the schedule, and it left the common support of six schedules disconnected, with no path at all. The combination rule is §7.2's: OR the bitfields, a block is safe only if every cell in it is. Done by sampling for now; it should call `query_conservative()` when the pyramid lands.

### 8.2 The money plot

Sweep `S` over schedules (5/10/20/40, 5/10/50, uniform 5, uniform 10, uniform 20, …). Plot memory on x, `R(S)` on y. The curve has a knee. The result reads:

> *"Below 8.9 MB the plan is unchanged — regret is exactly zero — and above the knee it degrades measurably. Our schedule sits at the knee."*

That single figure is worth more than every memory bar chart in the deck, because it answers the only question a sceptic actually has.

### 8.3 The online policy — one extra O(N) pass

Refining a region is only worth compute if refinement could change the decision. Run two Dijkstra passes on the coarse traversability grid:

```
f(c) = cost-to-come from start     (forward Dijkstra)
g(c) = cost-to-go to goal          (backward Dijkstra)
T(c) = f(c) + g(c)                 best path cost *through* c        (24)
```

`T(c) − J(π*)` is the *detour penalty* for routing through `c`. Refine only where

```
T(c) − J(π*) < τ                                                     (25)
```

— the corridor of near-optimal alternatives. **Cells outside that band cannot change the plan no matter how finely resolved, so refining them is provably wasted compute.** τ sets the budget and maps directly onto the refinement pool size.

This is the online form of the offline metric, and it is cheap: two Dijkstras over ~10⁵ coarse cells, well under a millisecond.

**Unit test.** Construct a synthetic map with a narrow gap. Assert `R(S) = 0` for schedules fine enough to resolve the gap and `R(S) > 0` for schedules coarser than the gap width. Assert cells flagged by (25) form a connected corridor containing `π*`.

---

## 9. Reference map and information-loss metrics

### 9.1 Construction

Aggregate all scans of a held-out sequence into one static cloud using GT poses and GT labels, remove `moving-*` points, rasterise at 5 cm with no LOD and no time limit. That is `M*`. It is schedule-independent, which is what makes cross-schedule comparison valid.

### 9.2 Per-ring height RMSE

For each coarse cell `c`, let `F(c)` be the set of reference fine cells it subsumes, and `h*_f` their reference heights.

```
RMSE_L = sqrt( (1/|C_L|) Σ_{c ∈ C_L} ( μ_c − h̄*(c) )² ),
         h̄*(c) = mean_{f ∈ F(c)} h*_f                               (26)
```

### 9.3 ⚑ The coarsening-justification ratio

The number that expresses the thesis. For coarse cell `c`, define information loss against the individual fine cells (not their mean):

```
IL(c)² = (1/|F|) Σ_{f ∈ F(c)} ( μ_c − h*_f )²
       = ( μ_c − h̄*(c) )²   +   Var_{f}( h*_f )
         └──── bias² ────┘       └── spread² ──┘                    (27)
```

by the standard bias–variance decomposition. `spread` is the **intrinsic** sub-cell terrain variability — it is what any single-value cell must pay, irrespective of algorithm. So define

```
ρ(c) = IL(c) / spread(c)                                            (28)
```

- `ρ ≈ 1` — coarsening cost only the intrinsic sub-cell variability. **Optimal; the saving was free.**
- `ρ ≫ 1` — your estimate is biased beyond the terrain's own roughness. The schedule is too aggressive, or fusion is wrong.

Report `ρ` per ring. It is the entire argument compressed to one dimensionless number, and it separates *what the representation costs* from *what the algorithm costs* — which nobody in the adaptive-mapping literature reports.

> **Note, 29 Aug — Aakash. `ρ` per ring is a ratio of aggregates, and it has a floor.** *(27) and (28) define IL and spread per cell and the section asks for ρ per ring, which leaves the aggregation unstated. The two readings are not close.*

> ***Mean of per-cell ratios is dominated by nearly-flat footprints***, *where `spread → 0` and any error at all gives an enormous ratio. Measured on the synthetic scene with every ring cell written the* exact *mean of its footprint — bias identically zero, so ρ must be 1 by construction — the mean of ratios reports **4.8** and the ratio of aggregates `rms(IL)/rms(spread)` reports **1.0**. Implemented as the ratio of aggregates.*
>
> ***And ρ cannot beat the storage.*** *Heights are stored to 1 cm, so IL can never fall below the quantisation noise `q/√12 = 0.29 cm` however good the estimate. Where the terrain's own spread is finer than that — smooth asphalt — ρ is bounded below by roughly `0.29/spread` and is measuring the representation's own quantisation rather than the coarsening. **Read ρ on rough ground; on glass-smooth ground read RMSE.** Worth a line in the report before a reviewer notices it first.*

### 9.4 Dynamic removal — both directions

```
DR = removed_dynamic / total_dynamic          (removal rate)
SP = preserved_static / total_static          (preservation rate)
F  = 2·DR·SP / (DR + SP)                                            (29)
```

Report all three. **DR alone is gameable** — delete the whole map and score 100%. The harmonic mean prevents that.

## 10. Occupancy, class fusion, reflectivity, visibility

### 10.1 Three-state occupancy

Log-odds with an explicit unknown state:

```
l ← clamp( l + log(p_meas/(1−p_meas)),  l_min,  l_max )             (30)

state = UNKNOWN   if n < n_min
        OCCUPIED  if l > l_occ
        FREE      otherwise
```

**Unknown is decided by observation count, not by log-odds.** "I looked and it's empty" and "I couldn't see" are different facts; a log-odds value near zero conflates them. Clamping prevents saturation — an unclamped cell that has seen 500 free observations needs 500 occupied ones to change its mind, which is why unclamped maps fail to register newly-appeared obstacles.

> **Note, 29 Aug — Aakash. `l_occ` had no value anywhere.** *The state rule above is the only place it appears, and `configs/thresholds.yaml` never defined it, so `occupancy_state()` had nothing to compare against. Added as `occupancy.log_odds_occupied: 0` — the neutral reading, "more hits than misses" — and frozen with the rest of that file. Flagged rather than quietly chosen because it is a threshold, and thresholds are frozen before schedules are compared (flaw E6).*
>
> *Two further points the section leaves implicit, both now in code. `fuse()` applies* hits *only: a return is evidence of occupancy, but the* absence *of a return is not evidence of free space — at the 1–2% single-frame fill rate of §1.3 it is mostly just the sampling. Free-space evidence comes from beams that passed through, i.e. §10.4. And `FLAG_BLIND` short-circuits to UNKNOWN whatever the log-odds say, so a blind-cone cell cannot be argued into FREE by a later frame's geometry.*

### 10.2 Class fusion in one byte — Boyer–Moore majority ⚑

A Dirichlet count vector over K classes needs K bytes; the cell budget allows one. Boyer–Moore streaming majority solves this in constant memory:

```
on observing class y:
    if counter == 0:        candidate ← y ;  counter ← 1
    elif y == candidate:    counter ← min(counter + 1, C)
    else:                   counter ← counter − 1
```

Packed as **5-bit candidate + 3-bit counter = 1 byte**, so `C = 7` and the candidate holds ids 0–31. Never average softmax vectors across frames — the mean of two confident, contradictory distributions is a confident-looking lie.

> **⚑ Correction, 1 Sep — Aakash. This section claimed a guarantee it does not have, and the claim was wrong at 4/4 too.** *The text used to read "guaranteed to return the true majority class whenever one exists". Boyer–Moore's proof assumes an **unbounded** counter. A saturating counter discards exactly the evidence the proof rests on: once the counter is pinned at `C`, further sightings of the majority class are not recorded, so `C + 1` contradicting observations can unseat a class holding a genuine strict majority.*
>
> *Demonstrated at both widths, which is the point — 5/3 did not introduce this, it halved the headroom:*
>
> | counter cap | sequence | true majority | candidate returned |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | 15 (the old 4/4) | `1`×32 then `2`×31 | `1`, 32 of 63 | **`2`** |
> | 7 (5/3) | `1`×16 then `2`×15 | `1`, 16 of 31 | **`2`** |
> | unbounded | either | `1` | `1` |
>
> *What the cell actually provides is therefore **a time constant, not a theorem**: the one-byte version is exactly textbook Boyer–Moore on any sequence whose running excess stays within `C`, and a cell changes its mind after more than `C` net contradicting observations. `C = 7` makes the map re-label about twice as fast as `C = 15` — for a rolling local map with dynamics in it that is arguably the better default, but it is a tuning claim and the report must not say "guaranteed majority" without the condition attached.*
>
> *Pinned in `test_saturation_is_what_bounds_the_guarantee`, and the honest equivalence is pinned separately in `test_boyer_moore_matches_the_textbook_until_the_counter_saturates`.*

> **✔ Resolved, 1 Sep — ratified at Gate 3, item 3. The byte is re-split 5 | 3.** *The conflict below is kept because what it cost is the argument for the fix, and because the same defect recurred three times while the fix was being applied.*
>
> *A 4-bit candidate held 16 ids; the learning set is 20 (0–19). The shortfall did not present as "some rare classes are missing" — it landed in three independent places, each of which read as working. **(a)** `pole` (18) and `traffic-sign` (19) are the two classes the semantic gate exists for — thin structures whose geometry is smaller than the cell they land in past 25 m — so the gate matched against ids no cell could report, fired on nothing, and nothing failed. **(b)** `terrain` (17) is one of the five `drivable_classes` the §7.1 predicate consults on every cell. **(c)** The first real frame raised rather than degrading, and two disagreeing stand-ins had grown around that raise: `% 16` in the eval harness, which mapped `terrain` onto `car` and so turned drivable ground into blocked cells, and `clip(0, 15)` in the frame loop, which mapped everything above 15 onto `vegetation`.*
>
> *5 bits holds the set with room to 31. Ids above 31 are still refused loudly rather than wrapped: a silent `% 32` would relabel class 32 as 0, and 0 is `unlabeled`, so a chunk of the map would quietly become unlabelled ground — plausible-looking and undetectable without the reference map. In practice an id above 31 now means RAW SemanticKITTI ids (10, 11, 40, 252, …) have reached the map where learning ids were expected, which is a different bug and one clipping would hide.*
>
> *The byte is still one byte, so the frozen 12-byte cell struct does not move and no memory figure changes.*
>
> **⚑ And the width was written out seven times.** *Applying a two-constant change surfaced six more places that spelled the split themselves: `>> 4` in `grid/traversability.py`, `grid/gate.py` and `grid/query.py`, and a hand-rolled `(id << 4) | 5` in two test fixtures and one script. Each would have kept reading a 4-bit field out of a 5-bit byte — which returns a valid-looking class id with the counter's top bit welded on, so every drivable cell fails the class test and the entire road reads untraversable. All of them now go through `pack_class` / `unpack_class`, and that is the actual lesson: the constant was never the problem, the copies were.*

### 10.3 Reflectivity normalisation

Raw intensity confounds surface reflectance with geometry. The LiDAR equation gives `I ∝ ρ cos θ_inc / r²`, so recover the intrinsic reflectance:

```
ρ̂ = I · r² / max(cos θ_inc, 0.1)      then normalise to [0,255]     (31)
```

Lane paint has `ρ ≈ 0.5`, dry asphalt `≈ 0.1`; **wet asphalt reflects specularly and returns almost nothing**, so `ρ̂ ≈ 0` on a cell classified `road` is a wet-surface indicator. One byte, no extra sensor, directly serves the drivable/non-drivable requirement.

### 10.4 Visibility cleanup — O(1) per cell, no ray casting

For map cell `c` at position `p`, project into the current range image:

```
(u, v) = proj(p) ,     r_expected = ‖p − p_sensor‖
clear c   iff   R_current(u,v) > r_expected + δ                     (32)
```

If the current beam returned from *further away* than the cell, the beam passed through it, so the cell is empty. This is a range comparison, not a 3D traversal — **O(1) per cell, fully parallel.**

**Guard, mandatory:** never clear a cell that has a return in the current scan. Without it, thin structures — fences, poles, sign posts — get eaten within a few frames. `δ` absorbs range noise; set `δ = 3σ_r(r)` from (12), so the guard band widens with distance automatically rather than being a hand-tuned constant.

### 10.5 Residual images for motion

Transform scan `t−k` into frame `t` and compare range images:

```
D_k(u,v) = | R_t(u,v) − R_{t←t−k}(u,v) |                            (33)
```

Static geometry cancels; moving objects leave a bright residual. Feed `{D_1, D_2, D_4}` as extra input channels. Note the detectability floor is (7): residuals cannot beat the geometric limit, so beyond ~25 m a pedestrian produces no residual and only the semantic prior remains.

## 11. Memory arithmetic — every number, with its assumptions

Ratios are pure cell-count ratios and therefore **invariant to bytes-per-cell**; absolute sizes are not. State both.

```
N_ours    = 745,000 cells                                 (19)
N_uniform = (200/0.05)² = 16,000,000 cells
N_dense3D = (200/0.05)² × (8/0.05) = 2.56 × 10⁹ voxels
```

| Representation | Assumption | Size | Ratio vs ours |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dense 3D voxel | 1 B/voxel, 8 m vertical extent | 2.56 GB | **286×** |
| Sparse/hashed 3D | surface-only, 8 B/voxel incl. hash overhead | ~130–240 MB | ~15–27× |
| Uniform 5 cm 2.5D | same 12 B cell | 192 MB | **21.5×** |
| **Ours, 4-ring** | 12 B cell | **8.94 MB** | — |
| Ours, 3-ring ablation | 12 B cell | 6.24 MB | 30.8× vs uniform |
| Conservative pyramid | 5 of 12 B, ×1/3 | +1.24 MB | overhead |
| Refinement pool | 512 × 16 × 12 B | +0.10 MB | fixed |
| **Total bound** | | **≈ 10.3 MB** | compile-time |

**Report the dense-3D, sparse-3D and uniform-2.5D numbers together, in that order.** The problem statement asks for the 3D comparison, so lead with it; volunteering the sparse figure before someone else raises it reads as good faith; the uniform-2.5D figure is the one that actually isolates *your* contribution from the 3D→2.5D reduction.
