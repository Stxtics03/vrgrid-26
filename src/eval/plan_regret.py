"""Plan regret — coarsening measured in units of decision. Math §8. [Aakash]

This is the research claim. Everything else in the project is engineering.

Plan on the reference map, plan on the compressed map, compare the DECISIONS,
not the reconstructions. If the planner reaches the same waypoint sequence,
the compression was free in the only sense a robot cares about.

It is also the answer to the hardest question you will be asked — "standard
planners want uniform grids, so you give the savings back in resampling" —
alongside the resolution-agnostic query API (§3.7) and the conservative
pyramid (§7.2). Three independent answers, which is why this is worth its days.

--- the one detail that decides whether the metric means anything ---------

    R(S) = J_{M*}(pi_S) - J_{M*}(pi*)                              eq. (23)

**Both paths are scored on M*.** Scoring pi_S on M_S measures self-consistency,
not quality: a badly coarsened map will happily report that its own bad plan is
cheap, and the metric comes out beautiful precisely when the map is worst.
`test_scoring_on_the_compressed_map_hides_the_damage` builds that case and
shows the wrong metric reporting ~0 where the right one reports a real detour.

Non-negativity is by construction, not by luck: pi* minimises J_{M*}, so
nothing scored on M* can beat it. A negative regret means the two costmaps are
not on the same lattice, and that is the first thing to check if one appears.

--- planning through query(), on purpose ---------------------------------

The planner runs on a uniform lattice at its OWN resolution and gets every
cell through `query()`, never by reaching into a ring. That is the §3.7 claim
being exercised rather than asserted: the planner does not know the map is
variable-resolution, and a planner that has to know is a planner that has to
be rewritten. The planning lattice is coarser than the map's finest ring by
design -- a vehicle plans in 25 cm steps, not 5 cm ones -- so this is not the
resampling the objection is about.

--- ⚑⚑ the confound that decides whether the ablation is valid at all -----

When this note was written the scene produced, at 14 frames and one
11 x 11 m planning window:

    schedule        R(S)     cells low-confidence in the window
    5/10/20/40      5.803    65%
    uniform 20 cm   0.146     4%

Read naively that says our schedule is forty times worse than a uniform grid.
It says nothing of the kind. Nothing is impassable in either map. The 5 cm
ring holds few returns per cell -- P_fill is 11.6% per frame at ring 0 and the
far field fills only by ego-motion (§1.3) -- so most of its cells are below
`n_min`, pay `w_unknown` plus the class penalty for an unset class byte, and
the planner routes around a map that is merely SPARSE rather than wrong.

⚑ **Those magnitudes no longer reproduce, and the reason is not that the
  confound went away.** Re-measured 2026-09-01 with
  `python scripts/eval_synthetic.py --frames 14 --confound`:

    schedule        R(S)     cells low-confidence in the window
    5/10/20/40      2.389     1%
    uniform 20 cm   3.354     0%

  The window is now 99.1% common support, so restricting it changes almost
  nothing -- unrestricted and restricted R(S) agree to three decimals. Two
  things moved underneath the old numbers: the planning window was repositioned
  behind the final pose rather than ahead of it (see `PLAN_BEHIND_M` in
  `scripts/eval_synthetic.py`, which records why), and the synthetic sampler's
  beam-surface intersection was wrong and is fixed, which raised coverage in
  every ring.

  The restriction stays, and the numbers are printed side by side, because how
  large this effect is depends on the scene, the window placement and the frame
  count -- none of which are frozen. It was 65% against 4% on one arrangement
  of them. An ablation that quotes R(S) across cell sizes without the
  restriction is not interpretable whatever the current gap happens to be.

**So R(S) compared across schedules with different cell sizes measures fill
rate, not coarsening, unless the comparison is restricted to ground all of
them have actually observed.** A finer schedule is penalised for resolving
finely, which is precisely backwards, and the effect is large enough to
reverse the headline.

`common_support()` builds that restriction: cells observed by every map in
the comparison, everything else excluded from both paths' cost. Use it for
any cross-schedule number. `unknown_fraction` is what makes the confound
visible when it is not used, which is why it is returned next to R(S) and not
buried -- an ablation quoting R(S) without it is not interpretable.

--- ⚑ unknown cannot be impassable here, and that is a real concession ----

The project's rule is "unknown is not free" and §7.1 bit 5 fails safe. For a
PLANNER that rule makes the metric undefined: at P_fill < 2% per frame (§1.3)
most of the far field has never been observed, so with unknown impassable no
path exists at all and R(S) cannot be computed for any schedule.

So unknown is passable at a price, `w_unknown` in `configs/thresholds.yaml`,
and `PlanResult.unknown_fraction` reports how much of each path went through
it. Read the two together: a regret of zero along a path that is 80% unknown
is not evidence that the coarsening was free, it is evidence that the sequence
was too short to fill the map. The fraction is not decoration -- it is the
condition under which the headline number means anything.

    Every planning cell is `samples x samples` `query()` calls over its
    footprint. What is done with those samples depends on what the bit MEANS,
    and getting that wrong is the whole of two defects found on Day 5.

    --- `predicate="planning"` (default): §7.1 on the PLANNING lattice -------

    The samples are reduced to one ground height and one within-cell variance
    per planning cell, and slope, step and roughness are then computed by the
    SAME `_slope` / `_max_step` / variance test that `costmap_from_reference`
    applies to M*'s block statistics -- literally the same functions, on the
    same lattice, at the same threshold.

    ⚑ This is not a refinement, it is a correctness fix, and the old
      behaviour is `predicate="map"` only so the old numbers can be
      reproduced. §7.1's thresholds are NOT scale-invariant: a step of `h`
      reads as a gradient of `h / 2c` at cell size `c`, so a 12 cm kerb is
      `1.20` on a 5 cm ring, `0.60` at 10 cm and `0.24` at 25 cm, against a
      flat `tan(20 deg) = 0.364`. M* is evaluated at `plan.cell_m` because
      `costmap_from_reference` blocks it down before setting any bit. So under
      `"map"` the two sides of eq. (23) applied the same predicate at
      DIFFERENT lattices, and the frozen schedules walled both kerbs into a
      corridor -- 154 cells M* calls flat -- while missing 10 of M*'s 12 real
      walls. The only schedule that agreed with M* was uniform 20 cm, and it
      agreed because its lattice was nearest M*'s, not because it was a good
      map. R(S) was measuring where a 12 cm kerb crosses a 20 degree
      threshold.

    Clearance and class are absent on BOTH sides, which is the price of
    symmetry and is stated rather than hidden. M* is 2.5D ground with no
    ceiling, so it can never set clearance; and although `ReferenceMap` does
    carry `class_id`, `costmap_from_reference` is built from `block_stats`,
    which is heights. Charging `w_class` on M_S against a reference that
    cannot charge it is a bias, not a measurement -- so under `"planning"` the
    comparison is geometric on both sides. Giving M* a block-majority class
    channel is the way to put it back, and until someone does, this is the
    honest version.

    --- how the samples combine, per bit ------------------------------------

    A hazard is OR-ed: present anywhere in the cell, the cell is unsafe. That
    is §7.2's conservative-pyramid rule and it is right for bits 0-2.

    ⚑ Bit 5 is NOT a hazard and must not use that rule. It says "too few
      observations to judge", so OR-ing it marks a planning cell
      low-confidence if ANY of its 25 sub-samples is thin -- which at ring 0's
      fill rate is essentially always, and it charged `w_unknown` on 91.9% of
      the window for the frozen schedules against 4.1% for uniform 20 cm.
      That is the fill-rate confound reappearing as a weight, and
      `common_support()` did not remove it because that masks on `unknown`,
      a different array. Confidence is therefore combined the same way
      `unknown` already was -- the cell is confident if ANY sample is -- which
      makes the two consistent instead of exactly inverted.

    Slow, and deliberately so: the claim being demonstrated is that a planner
    can treat this map as uniform, and reaching into the rings to go faster
    here would assume away the thing under test.

      the hazard cells themselves, because a 40 cm hole is exactly the thing a
      LiDAR gets few returns from, and it punches enough holes in the far rows
      to disconnect the corridor. Both maps then call the pothole impassable
