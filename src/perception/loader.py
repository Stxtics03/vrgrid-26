"""SemanticKITTI loader. [JP — Day 0, first task]

Sequences 00, 07, 08 only — about 40 GB, not the full 200 GB. Start the
download before anything else on Day 0; it is the one item on the critical
path that neither cleverness nor effort can accelerate.

Motion labels come straight out of the raw `.label` files (`moving-*`,
IDs 250-259). Nothing is retrained. Disclose it plainly in the report: motion
labels are ground truth, so the mapping contribution is evaluated independently
of segmentation quality. That is a feature — it isolates the contribution from
segmentation error.

Data root is set by the `VRGRID_DATA_ROOT` environment variable and must hold
the KITTI odometry layout:

    $VRGRID_DATA_ROOT/poses/<seq>.txt                    official GT poses
    $VRGRID_DATA_ROOT/sequences/<seq>/velodyne/*.bin
    $VRGRID_DATA_ROOT/sequences/<seq>/labels/*.label     SemanticKITTI labels
    $VRGRID_DATA_ROOT/sequences/<seq>/calib.txt

We use the OFFICIAL KITTI GT poses from `poses/<seq>.txt`, not the SemanticKITTI
internal SLAM poses at `sequences/<seq>/poses.txt`. If the variable is unset it
defaults to `./data` (the gitignored data dir at the repo root); set it
explicitly if your download lives elsewhere -- see the README.

# --- which pose file a sequence is read with ---------------------------------
#
# Two exist per sequence and they are not interchangeable:
#
#   poses/<seq>.txt              official KITTI ground truth, a GPS/IMU
#                                solution optimised for TRAJECTORY evaluation
#   sequences/<seq>/poses.txt    SemanticKITTI's own SLAM poses, optimised so
#                                scans REGISTER into a consistent map
#
# README.md:21 chose the official ones on Day 0, which is right for most
# sequences and wrong for 08. Measured as the median absolute ground-height
# disagreement between consecutive frames, in 20 cm cells both frames saw:
#
#       seq        GT poses     SLAM poses
#        07          0.49 cm       0.66 cm
#        08         16.63 cm       1.04 cm     <-- 16x better
#
# 08's GT poses put the same patch of road 16.6 cm apart from one frame to the
# next, consistently -- 16.1 to 17.6 cm across every pair, so a systematic
# offset rather than drift. A cell seen over N frames accumulates about
# N x 16.6 cm, which made M* itself carry a 64.5 cm median standard deviation
# INSIDE a 10 cm footprint and put seq 08's per-ring RMSE at 162 cm.
#
# ⚑ THE PER-FRAME MEASURE ABOVE IS A WEAK PREDICTOR, and choosing this list
#   from it alone was wrong. It catches 08 because 08 is catastrophic, and it
#   misses everything subtler: seq 00 disagrees by only 2.27 cm per frame yet
#   ACCUMULATES a mean height bias of -13.95 cm by ring 3, while seq 03 at a
#   comparable 1.97 cm/frame accumulates -0.80. What matters is the
#   accumulated bias, measured per ring against M*:
#
#       seq   per-frame   mean_b r1   mean_b r2   mean_b r3
#        00      2.27cm       -2.86       -9.85      -13.95   <-- SLAM
#        06      1.32cm       -0.34       -3.32       -5.80
#        03      1.97cm       -1.91       +2.45       -0.80
#        others  1.0-1.4cm    < |0.8|     < |2.3|     < |2.9|
#
#   Switching 00 to SLAM takes ring 2's bias from -9.85 to -0.44 cm and ring
#   3's from -13.95 to -1.18, with ring 3 RMSE 26.03 -> 13.57. Sequence 06,
#   the next worst, was tested the same way and is a WASH -- GT better at ring
#   1, SLAM marginally better at rings 2-3 -- so it stays on GT. Only the two
#   sequences with a measured win are overridden.
#

# overridable rather than assumed. `VRGRID_POSE_SOURCE` forces one globally,
