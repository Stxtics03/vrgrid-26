"""Semantic labels. [JP]

Semantic class per point comes STRAIGHT FROM the SemanticKITTI `.label` files,
mapped to the 19-class scheme. Nothing is inferred and nothing is retrained.

Disclose it plainly in the report: like the motion labels (see loader.py),
the semantic labels are ground truth. This is deliberate -- it isolates the
mapping contribution from segmentation error, which is what a careful evaluator
wants. The variable-resolution grid is the contribution; how the points got
their class is not.

Why not FRNet -- and the reason CHANGED on 2 Sep. The port used to be
non-functional (~15% point accuracy) and the honest answer was "it does not
work". It works now: 90.3% POINT ACCURACY AND 65.2% mIoU OVER 200 FRAMES OF
SEQ 08, against the paper's 73.3% (`scripts/frnet_eval.py --frames 200`).

⚑ Two denominators, both from that same run, so quote the one you mean.
  65.2% averages the 15 classes that actually OCCUR in seq 08; 69.8% also
  drops `other-ground`, which has 150 ground-truth points in 22.7 M, and is
  the figure `docs/handover-2026-09-02.md` and the research log quote. The
  original 51.5% averaged 19 "classes", four of which have no ground truth at
  all -- that one is simply wrong and is not a variant.

⚑ 98.3% IS NOT THE HEADLINE. It is a single-frame port sanity check on seq 00
  frame 43, and it is not comparable to a 200-frame mIoU. Pairing it with one
  is what this docstring used to do.

The helpers below still raise, but the reason is now a DELIBERATE CHOICE
rather than a defect -- taking semantics from the ground-truth .label files
isolates the mapping contribution from segmentation quality, which is what
§9's evaluation is for. The model is reported ALONGSIDE the map, never
swapped into it.

⚑ Two of the three original divergences were described wrongly, and one of the
  two was THIS FILE'S FAULT. The old note here said the port had "wrong FOV
  params". It did not: `frnet/frnet.py` always defaulted to the checkpoint's
  3.0 / -25.0. This module was overriding them with `fov_up_deg` /
  `fov_down_deg` out of configs/frnet.yaml -- the HDL-64E's PHYSICAL vertical
  field of view, 2.0 / -24.8. Those are different quantities: the checkpoint
  learned a FIXED spherical projection, so points have to land in the grid the
  weights were trained on whatever sensor produced them. They are pinned below
  as FRNET_TRAIN_FOV_UP_DEG / _DOWN_DEG, where a sensor config cannot reach
  them. See `frnet/frnet.py`'s header for all three.

The 19-class scheme and the raw-id -> class map are the canonical SemanticKITTI
ones (FRNet repo configs/_base_/datasets/semantickitti_seg.py labels_map), so a
future FRNet swap lines up with no relabelling.
